## 1. Scoring System Design (40%)

Our custom scoring system evaluates resumes against job descriptions using three main components:

### 1.1 Keyword Overlap Score (40%)
- Extracts keywords from both JD and resume
- Calculates intersection of keywords
- Score = (matched keywords / total JD keywords) * 40
- Emphasizes presence of required skills and qualifications

### 1.2 Skill Frequency Analysis (30%)
- Measures frequency of technical skills in resume
- Focuses on common industry terms like:
  - Programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript)
  - Frameworks (Django, Flask, React)
  - Tools (Git, Docker, AWS)
- Score = min(frequency_sum * 2, 30)
- Rewards depth of experience in key areas

### 1.3 Phrase Match Scoring (30%)
- Identifies complete phrase matches
- Targets important phrases like:
  - "years experience"
  - "team lead"
  - "software engineer"
- Score = (matched phrases / total key phrases) * 30
- Values contextual relevance

## 2. Sample Results

### 2.1 Job Description
```
Software Developer Position
- Python programming (5+ years experience)
- Web development with Django or Flask
- Experience with RESTful APIs
- Database design and SQL
- Git version control
